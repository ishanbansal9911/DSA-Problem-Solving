# DSA Problem Solving
## **About this repository**

- Welcome to **DSA-Problem-Solving** — my personal repository for consistently practicing and strengthening my skills in **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** with **C++**.  
- This project serves as a transparent, trackable record of my commitment to mastering problem-solving, building efficient algorithms, and growing as a technical professional.

---

## **Purpose**

- Build a strong, practical foundation in key DSA topics.
- Tackle a diverse range of problems: Arrays, Strings, Linked Lists, Trees, Graphs, Dynamic Programming, and more.
- Develop speed, accuracy, and clear thinking for coding interviews and real-world technical work.
- Demonstrate consistent learning and growth through regular, well-structured commits.

## **What’s included**

- Clearly organized folders by topic for easy navigation.
- All solutions written in **C++**, using clean, efficient, and readable code.
- Many solutions include comments to show clear understanding.
- New problems are added regularly to reflect my continuous practice and progress.

## **Why this matters**

- Strong problem-solving skills are essential for anyone in technology — whether building robust software, tackling complex logic, or succeeding in technical interviews.  
- This repository shows my proactive approach to growing these skills through real, hands-on practice. By working through challenging problems and documenting solutions, I’m developing the mindset and technical ability needed to deliver high-quality, efficient solutions in any setting.
